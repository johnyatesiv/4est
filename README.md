# Project README File

h1.4est Code Base
    This is the 4est Code Base. All submissions should conform to the guiding principles and
    style guide described in subsequent sections.

h1.Guiding Principles
    h3.1. Transparency is paramount.
        The 4est code base must always be accessible and auditable by our users.
        Exceptions are only allowed when revealing code would enable malicious actors
        to compromise the integrity of the platform.

    h3.2. Democracy is key.
        Pull requests and forks of the code will be rejected if they do not specifically
        address an issue raised in the community forum.

    h3.3. Politics are politics, facts are facts.
        Contributors to this project affirm and abide by the principle that facts are not
        subject to politicization, and that truth is obtained through strict and well planned
        methodologies.

h1.Style Guide
    h3.1. Avoid condensed conditionals
    h3.2. Wrap lines after 80 characters
    h3.3. Tab indents, no trailing whitespaces
